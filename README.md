# Image Quantification Automation

<<<<<<< codex/create-macos-image-quantification-automation-bl5jbk
This repository contains a command-line tool for macOS that automates an image quantification workflow **using your existing Ima
geJ or Fiji installation**. The program collects every piece of configuration it needsâ€”ImageJ location, image folder, thresholdin
g method, measurements, and Excel export destinationâ€”before a single image is processed.

## Requirements

1. A working copy of [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) installed on your Mac. The
 script runs ImageJ headlessly, so make sure it launches normally before using the automation.
2. Python 3.9+ with the `openpyxl` package:

This repository contains a command-line tool for macOS that automates a common image quantification workflow. The program walks you through configuration (input folder, thresholding method, measurements, and Excel export location) before processing images.

## Requirements

Install the Python dependencies:
>>>>>>> main

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you do not already have the package installed system-wide, consider creating a virtual environment first:
>
> ```bash
> python3 -m venv .venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

## Usage

1. Confirm ImageJ or Fiji opens correctly on your machine (double-click the application and make sure it starts without errors).
2. Place all images you want to quantify in a single folder. Supported formats include `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tif`, `.tiff`,
 and `.bmp`.
3. Run the script and answer the prompts:

## Usage

Run the script and answer the prompts to configure the workflow:
>>>>>>> main

```bash
python3 quantify_images.py
```

### Interactive configuration walkthrough

When you run the command, the script asks a series of questions so it can fully configure itself before launching ImageJ:

1. **ImageJ application path** â€“ Paste the `.app` bundle (for example `/Applications/Fiji.app`) or the executable inside `Content
s/MacOS`. The script automatically resolves the actual binary that will be launched headlessly.
2. **Image folder** â€“ Provide the directory containing the images to process. Only the top-level files in that folder are touched
; subdirectories are ignored.
3. **Threshold method** â€“ Choose one of the following:
   * `none` â€“ Convert to grayscale and 32-bit but do not limit measurements to a thresholded region.
   * `otsu` â€“ Use ImageJâ€™s Otsu auto-threshold and limit measurements to the resulting mask.
   * `manual` â€“ Supply an explicit lower threshold between 0 and 255. Measurements are limited to pixels above this threshold.
4. **Measurements** â€“ Enter a comma-separated list of measurement keys. Press enter to accept the default set (`mean_intensity`, `
std_dev`, `sum_intensity`, `foreground_area`). Each key maps directly to ImageJ measurements:
   * `mean_intensity` â†’ Mean
   * `std_dev` â†’ Standard Deviation
   * `sum_intensity` â†’ Integrated Density
   * `foreground_area` â†’ Area (pixel count)
   * `min_intensity` â†’ Minimum intensity
   * `max_intensity` â†’ Maximum intensity
5. **Excel output path** â€“ Accept the suggested destination inside your image folder or supply another `.xlsx` path. The director
y is created automatically when it doesnâ€™t exist.
6. **Confirmation** â€“ Review a summary of your selections and type `y` to start processing. Typing anything else cancels the run b
efore ImageJ launches.

After confirmation the script will:

1. Generate an ImageJ macro tailored to your answers.
2. Run ImageJ in headless mode to process every supported image in the chosen folder.
3. For each file, convert it to 8-bit grayscale, apply the selected threshold (if any), convert to 32-bit, and run the requested m
easur
ements with ImageJâ€™s measurement engine.
4. Export ImageJâ€™s results table to a temporary CSV file and convert it into an Excel workbook at your chosen destination.

### Understanding the Excel report

The workbook contains a single sheet named **Measurements**. Each row corresponds to a processed image and includes:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `Image` | The filename processed by ImageJ. |
| `Threshold Applied` | The lower threshold value used, or `-` when no threshold was applied. |
| Measurement columns | One column per measurement you selected (e.g., *Mean Intensity*, *Foreground Area (px)*). |

You can re-run the program on the same folder at any timeâ€”existing Excel files are overwritten only after a successful export.

If you need to adapt the workflow (for example, additional ImageJ measurements or nested folder traversal), feel free to share th
e desired changes and they can be incorporated into a follow-up script update.
=======
The program will:

1. Ask for the folder containing images.
2. Ask any additional questions needed to fully configure the run, including threshold method, measurements, and Excel output path.
3. Convert each image to grayscale (black and white) and, when thresholding is enabled, create a binary mask.
4. Convert the processed pixels to 32-bit floating point data.
5. Compute the requested measurements for every image.
6. Export the measurements to an Excel workbook.

Supported image formats include PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, and BMP. The resulting Excel workbook is saved to the location you choose during configuration.
